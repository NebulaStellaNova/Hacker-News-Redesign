About This Redesign.
Hello, I am Nebula S. Nova.
I created this redesign as a way to get my knowledge/abilities on coding out there. With hopes that someone might hire me. I can code in various major languages; C++, HTML, JavaScript, Java, LUA, HaxeFlixel, Python, and more.

Why doesn't the login/signup or work and/or why isn't there an upload button?
This is not the real Hacker News website, I don't have access to user information. Nor do I have access to the post upload system. This also means that I have no access to the upvote system, the comment system, or the other user interaction systems.

Why isn't the tabbing in the comment sections right?
I don't exactly know. Making the tabbing correct requires alot of math, which I did wrong.

If you want to buy the website it'll cost you $2,368 (I worked on this site for 37 hours, the average Website Programmer and Designer is $64/h)
If you want me to keep updating it'll cost you an extra $64/h.


NOTES:

Opera GX tends to not work right after a new update is released, if the changelog says something is fixed and it doesn't work on Opera GX, try another browser.
